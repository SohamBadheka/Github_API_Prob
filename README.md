# Github_API_Prob

This is a Mean Stack based web application where I have used Github API to provide user the facility to enter the organization name and after then he can get the repository information.
Here, user can click on a perticular repository and check the list of commits in that specific repository.
At the same time, he will be listed the information about each individual commits.
Moreover, if the user clicks on the author of the commit, he would be redirected to the person's profile.
